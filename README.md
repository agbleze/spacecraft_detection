# Spacecraft Detection with various models
This repo is the codebase for a typical template for object detection tasks with focused of 
finetuning Faster RCNN and SSD. It is meant to be a starting point to draw inspirations 
for ease of adaptation for future projects. The codebase has several snippets from 
the NASA Space detection competition on DataDriven platform
